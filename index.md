**Set Up**
1. Gather the necessary materials:
* A medium-sized bucket/clean, empty trash can
* Dish soap
* Garden Hose
* Car sponge (alternative: old kitchen sponges)
* (2x) Microfiber rags(alternative: unwanted t-shirts)
* Old toothbrush
* Chain degreaser
* Wet chain lubricant

2. Fill the bucket with roughly one gallon of water from the hose.
3. Pour in about 20 drops of dish soap.
4. Add another half-gallon of water from the hose and mix to form a bubbly mixture.
5. Flip the bike so that the seat and the handlebars are touching the ground as shown in the picture above. This will keep the bike upright and make it easier to clean the drivetrain.

**Washing the Frame and Wheels**
6\. Using the hose, rinse off any large buildups of dirt using a low-pressure hose setting (forexample, showermode instead of jet mode). CAUTION: Do not force water into the marked areas shown in this picture as this can lead to seized bearings. They can be wet, but do not force water inside the frame.
7\. Using your old toothbrush, brush away residue from the gears. There maybe a lot of residue, so you can rinse the brush in your bucket of soapy water.
8\. Dip the car sponge into the bucket of soapy water and wipe dirt off of the frame.
9\. Use the sponge to thoroughly clean the rims and spokes of both wheels.

**Cleaning the Chain**
10\. Spray the chain degreaser liberally onto the chain and gears, spinning the pedals when necessary. NOTE: There are many kinds of chain degreaser; follow the directions for yours specifically.
11\. Let the degreaser sit on the components for two to five minutes.
12\. Rinse the whole bike off completely with the hose
13\. Wipe the chain dry with the first microfiber cloth. Hold the cloth on the chain and turn the pedals. CAUTION: Keep your fingers out of moving components to avoid pinch points.
14\. Apply one drop of wet lubricant to each link of the chain, spinning the pedals when necessary.
 
**Finishing Up**
15\. After applying the lubricant, spin the pedals on different gears to work the lubricant into the drivetrain.\
16\. Wipe off any excess lubricant with the first microfiber cloth.
17\. Spin the pedal and shift the back gears up and down to check for smooth shifting. If there is loud creaking, apply more lubricant to the chain.
18\. Wipe off excess water with the second microfiber cloth.
19\. Allow the bike to dry off in the sun.
